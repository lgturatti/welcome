# Welcome! Awesome stuff available on Internet

I intend to put all the bookmarks I have here, whether from my computer or my cell phone.

The most recent items will be inserted directly here, while I organize a solution to check if the links remain active and some pre-organization by topics or keywords.

While this is not ready, use your browser's search function to find the words or topics you want.

Oh! And don't forget to give a star if this content was useful to you. Thank you for your visit.
